            <h2>The Global Energy Transition</h2>
            <p>The world is currently undergoing a massive shift from fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas) to cleaner, renewable sources. This transition is not just about environmental safety; it's about energy independence and creating a stable, long-term power supply for all nations.  </p>
            
            <h3>Advanced Technologies Driving Change</h3>
            <p>While solar, wind, and hydro are the backbone, other technologies are essential for managing a fully clean power grid. These innovations address the challenge of intermittency (when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing):</p>

                    <h4>Energy Storage (Batteries)</h4>
                    <p>Large-scale battery systems store excess renewable power and discharge it when needed. This ensures electricity is available 24/7, balancing the grid.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Geothermal Power</h4>
                    <p>Harnessing stable heat from the Earth's core. Geothermal is highly reliable because it produces power continuously, regardless of weather.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Green Hydrogen</h4>
                    <p>Hydrogen produced using renewable electricity (electrolysis). It can be used as a clean fuel for heavy transport, industry, and long-term storage.</p>
